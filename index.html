            <h2 class="heading">My Cybersecurity <span>Journey</span></h2>
            <p>I have always been fascinated with technology, wanting to know how things worked and taking things apart (putting them back together). 
                I never considered working in IT because I wanted to do more than fix or troubleshoot hardware. I spent many years working in industries 
                that didn't give me a sense of purpose.<p>
                
                <p>However, those different industries did allow me to see technology in a different light. I became curious about the "internal" aspects of technology. 
                Working in customer service taught me about cloud computing and the importance of keeping users and their information safe in the cloud. From my warehouse experience, 
                I learned the importance of managing time by automating tasks and using AI. I soon realized that the world of technology continues to evolve.<p>
                
                <p>Technology is so much more than hardware or software. Whether it be the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, or "the cloud," 
                these advancements have made humans more vulnerable. The industries I decided to work in prior were not just another paycheck; I wanted to contribute to society. 
                Unfortunately, I didn't have the opportunity to do that in a big way. As I stepped outside the insightful yet draining career paths, I embarked on a new journey to discover 
                what technology could offer my future and what I could offer in return.<p>
                
               <p>While many of us are consuming technology, I am thinking of how I can transfer my soft skills to keep us safe while we do so. 
                Studying cybersecurity this past year (both academic and personal) has given me a purpose and created a passion. I am eager to learn and grow in the field, but more specifically, 
                I want to secure, protect, and educate users and organizations on its importance.</p>
