# üõ°Ô∏è Azure SOC Lab ‚Äî Cloud & Network Security Operations Project

## Overview
This project is a **hands-on Azure Security Operations Center (SOC) lab** designed to simulate real-world monitoring, detection, and response within a hybrid environment.  
It integrates **Microsoft Sentinel**, **Defender for Cloud**, and a **simulated on-prem network** (built in Cisco Packet Tracer) to demonstrate end-to-end threat visibility and incident response capabilities.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Build a functioning **SOC environment** using Azure services.
- Configure **data connectors**, **analytic rules**, and **alert automation** in Microsoft Sentinel.
- Simulate and respond to **realistic security events** (e.g., impossible travel, suspicious sign-ins).
- Visualize an on-prem to cloud topology using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
- Strengthen understanding of **network infrastructure**, **VLANs**, **firewalls**, and **SIEM integration**.

## üß© Architecture & Components

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Azure Cloud Environment
- **Azure Active Directory (Entra ID)** ‚Äî User identities for simulated organization.
- **Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM)** ‚Äî Central log aggregation, alerting, and threat detection.
- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud / CSPM** ‚Äî Cloud posture management and alert generation.
- **Log Analytics Workspace** ‚Äî Storage and query engine for Sentinel data.
- **Logic Apps** ‚Äî Automated response workflows (email notifications to SOC team).
- **SendGrid Integration** ‚Äî Custom email notifications for Sentinel alerts.

### üñß On-Prem Network Simulation (Cisco Packet Tracer)
- **DSL Modem ‚Üí Router ‚Üí Firewall ‚Üí Core Switch (3560)** ‚Üí Access Switches (2950A, 2950B)
- **Endpoints:** 5 Workstations + 5 Laptops (representing Azure AD users)
- **Servers:**
  - Domain Controller / Authentication Server (Simulated)
  - SOC Server (Syslog / Monitoring)
  - Web Server (Public-facing asset)
- **VLANs:**
  - VLAN 10 ‚Äì HR / Finance  
  - VLAN 20 ‚Äì IT / SOC  
  - VLAN 30 ‚Äì Operations  
  - VLAN 99 ‚Äì Management

### üîí Security Layers
- **Firewall (ASA 5505)** controlling traffic between internal VLANs and external Internet.
- **Trunked Core Switch** carrying multiple VLANs to access switches.
- **Router Configured for WAN connectivity (DSL Cloud Simulation)**.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** for basic segmentation.
